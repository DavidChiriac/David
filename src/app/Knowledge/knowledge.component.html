    As a 4 year student at Faculty of Automatic Control and Computer Engineering in Iasi I used a lot of languages and technologies.<br>
    Different projects and documentations that I worked on made me develop a very important skill: that I can adapt to almost any
    programming language, framework or IDE.<br>
    When it comes to what I studied:
    <ul>
        <li *ngFor="let skill of fromFaculty">
            {{skill}}
        </li>
    </ul>
